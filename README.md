# About

Hello, I am Joshua Cheng, a Robotics Software Engineer. I love cool robots and making them do crazy things. I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Northeastern University. Below is a list of some projects I've worked on recently.

# Projects

## [Northeastern Underwater Robotics](https://github.com/NEURoboticsClub/neu-underwater-robotics)

- I competed in the [MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/) underwater ROV competition for 7 years (all 4 years of high school and 3 years at Northeastern)
- We finished 8th in the 2023 World Championships in our rookie year!
- I wrote most of the controls code (Python) for the 2022-2024 seasons, and was the software team lead for 2022-2024

## [Low-Cost Underwater Acoustic Release](https://github.com/Sound-Floats/deckbox)
- For our Senior Capstone project, we created a low-cost acoustic release to anchor then release underwater acoustic sensors.
- The link above links to the repo with our code for the deck box, a waterproof box for communicating and controlling the acoustic releases.

## [Two Axis Object Tracking Camera](https://github.com/joshua2020181/rsn-final-project)
- This was the final project submission for my Robotics Sensing and Navigation class in the Spring of 2024
- It is a standard USB webcam mounted on two servos to allow for pan and tilt motion
- I used OpenCV for the object detection, and sent simple serial commands to the Arduino to command the servos
